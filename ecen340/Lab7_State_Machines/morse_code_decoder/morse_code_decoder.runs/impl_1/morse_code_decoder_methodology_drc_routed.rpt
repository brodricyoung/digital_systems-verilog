Non-clocked latch  
The latch next_state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin next_state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch next_state_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin next_state_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch next_state_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin next_state_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch next_state_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin next_state_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 5 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
